# Key Performance Indicators in Automation Systems for Manufacturing

In Manufacturing Operations we have key index's that is worthwhile monitoring , One such index is the OEE which stands for Overall Equipment Effectiveness . This is one of the most favourite measurement in the manufacturing operations , OEE index is an indicator for the efficency for work units or the entire work center.
the microservice allows you to capture and analyze OEE of Station / cell in Manufacturing line. This Microservice can be used with existing software systems along with orion context broker. the Graphana Pluggin allows you to visualize the OEE Metric ( Availablity , Quality and Performance indicators) by a given station and a given product.

The vision here is that no matter what the product or the station in the prodcution line , we will be able to capture the OEE and this value will help the operation mangers see the bottle necks int the production line and also usage of the equipments .

## OEEGrafanaVisualizer

The plugin built with React.js for Grafana Panel and provides representation of the results of OEE (Overall Equipment Effectiveness) for specific device in bar chart and additionnaly lines for `Availability`, `Performance`, `Quality`.

## OEEDataModel

OEE Data Model is represent the data that can be used in [OEEMicroservice](https://github.com/Exsensio-Ltd/OEEMicroservice) that is directly communicate with Fiware context broker.
